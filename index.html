  <title>Trusted Friend Shill</title>

You're seeing this because you’re a trusted friend on the internet.

I’m about to shill a coin. It’ll probably fail.

The idea: a coin you only talk about in DMs, not in any public spaces.

Most coins die early because of a coordinated cabal that owns way too much of the supply. This idea should stave that off as much as possible because we’re naturally gonna grow slowly and because of the below rules.

The rules:
- Only talk about it in the DMs.
- Don’t post about it in public until then.
- Don’t buy more than 0.5% of the supply. Any more and it’s less attractive to future holders. And obviously think of how much you’re willing to lose (and cut that to 10%). If you do see someone owns more than 0.5% of the supply, don’t buy.

The result? A slow growing dump-resistant coin that has never been done before.

No TG group, no X community. If you have questions, DM the holder who sent you here. If they don't know, ask them to DM whoever told them about it.

Now eventually the cat will be out of the bag and out in public, but the goal is to get to 5000 holders before then. Hopefully that will mean we avoid the dumpers and big supply holders during that critical time.

We’re currently at [number] holders.

if you buy then share your wallet address (optional) and we may airdrop later (locked so it doesn’t kill price).

If you have any questions or ideas let me know.
